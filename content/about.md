Hi there, I am Soby Chacko. I am a software engineer and an open source enthusiast. I am a committer to a few Spring projects, focussing primarily on Spring Cloud Stream and Spring Cloud Data Flow. My main area of interests are stream processing, data intensive architectures and cloud computing in general. This is my technical blog where I scribble random thoughts on programming and software craftsmanship in general. These are just my own opinions.
